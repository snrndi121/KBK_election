# system setting
- This project is based on Bitcoin open source. So you have to install bitcoin(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git). We don't explain that Install guide.

- After the intallation is done, move '/system.op/bitcmd/*' into 'userPath/bitcoin/src/'. The contents is the shell script commanding the bitcoind, like start, stop and etc command.

  - The shell script must be modified because this project is not supported the completed automake. So see the script below.
